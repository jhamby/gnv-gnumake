This is a repository for a package that is a component of the GNV project
for VMS.

Its purpose is to provide a record of the source used for the GNV packaged
version of the product.

This repository is for the GNV fork of GNU make 3.78.1.

We are in the process of merging this fork back into the upstream GNU make
projects.  When that merge is complete, this repository will be frozen.

Only simple bug fixes will be applied to this fork, which exists to allow
building a PCSI kit of existing GNV make for used until the merge is done.

The original unmodified GNV source is located in the reference/ directory and
all additional VMS specific changes are located in the vms_source directory.

A VMS concealed logical name of src_root: is for the reference directory and
a VMS concealed logical name of vms_root: is set ot the vms_source directory.

These are kept separate to make it easy to determine what VMS specific changes
where made and to allow retargeting the src_root: to a different version to
easily support maintaining multiple versions such as release, beta, and trunk
at the same time.

The user can then create a logical name of lcl_root: for the directory that
will contain the build products.  The lcl_root: directory tree is the only
directory tree that the build procedure should be modifying.

A logcal name search list of prj_root: is set to lcl_root:,vms_root:,src_root:
for building the package.

Mercurial was chosen for the repository as there are clients that can run on
VMS that is native to it.
